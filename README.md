# The-Weather-Channel
A functional website that shows temperature and climate in real time.
I use the Ajax in jquery to make my API come alive into my code.
I spent extensive time trying to get the formatting right on this repo by adding containers, cards, and search bars.
Alot of what I did on this homework was from unit 6 so i mainly used to appropriate content to create this almost done website.
Getting the JQueary to work on this assignment was actually kinda difficult because I didnt want to rely to much on the activites because i feel that this takes away from my learning experience.
